## Survey Consent Form

Before you begin the survey, please review the following consent form:

Thank you for participating in our research study (the “Study”)! As a participant in the Study, you can help Grammarly, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “Grammarly”) make our current and future products, features and services (the “Grammarly Products”) even better by providing us with your Feedback (defined below). The Study is governed by these Research Study Participation Terms (these “Terms”), which form a binding agreement between Grammarly and you. If you are participating in the Study on behalf of your company, then you are also agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your company. The parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Study Participation. As part of the Study, we may solicit your Feedback in a variety of ways, including through surveys, screen sharing, and conversations with Grammarly personnel. We may conduct the Study at Grammarly facilities, through other venues, and remotely. Your decision to participate is purely voluntary and you may end a Study session at any time. Questions about the Study can be directed to <research@grammarly.com>.

2. Study Data Collection, Use, and Disclosure. As part of this study, the information collected from you may include the following (“Study Data”):

    Feedback. We invited you to participate in the Study because we value your opinion. We ask that you provide us with suggestions, comments, opinions, improvements, ideas, information, or other feedback about the Grammarly Products, how you use the Grammarly Products, or what you might like to see from Grammarly in the future (“Feedback”). Feedback also includes information we learn from Study sessions. We are not required to use your Feedback, but for any Feedback you provide, you hereby grant Grammarly a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, or exploit the Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.

3. Recordings. We may make audio or video recordings of you (which may include your use of the Grammarly Products), including your name, voice, images, photograph, and/or likeness. You hereby consent to those recordings.  We may use the recordings internally to analyze your Feedback and to improve the Grammarly Products, design new products and educate our team. We will not share the recordings with the public without your prior written permission. If you prefer that we not make these recordings, please let us know.

4. Benefits to You. If you participate in the Study, Grammarly may provide you with compensation or an item, such as a gift card or t-shirt (subject to availability and your successful completion of the Study) and you may ultimately get to see your Feedback incorporated into the Grammarly Products. Otherwise, unless specified by Grammarly, you will not receive any fee, royalty or other compensation. You acknowledge the receipt and sufficiency of consideration for your participation.

5. Confidentiality; Ownership. Information you learn about the Grammarly Products (including any new products and features or other prototypes), your Feedback, and any other information and materials you receive or learn by participating in the Study (“Confidential Information”) are highly confidential to Grammarly. You agree not to disclose, discuss, blog or otherwise share any Confidential Information with anyone else, and not to record, photograph, video or otherwise capture any element of the Study. You agree to use Confidential Information only as part of your participation in the Study and for no other purpose. Finally, you agree not to disclose to Grammarly any third-party information that you are otherwise obligated to maintain as confidential. If you breach this Section 5, Grammarly will be entitled to seek equitable relief to protect its Confidential Information (among other remedies). Grammarly and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Confidential Information, the Grammarly Products, any related or underlying technology and documentation, and any modifications or derivative works thereof, including as may incorporate any Feedback. Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, power and authority to (1) enter these Terms and (2) participate in the Study, including providing and granting us the rights to Feedback in Section 2, all without violating any terms or policies by which you are bound, and without any requirement for Grammarly to obtain additional licenses, consents or permissions from others.

6. Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, power and authority to (1) enter these Terms and (2) participate in the Study, including providing and granting us the rights to Feedback in Section 2, all without violating any terms or policies by which you are bound, and without any requirement for Grammarly to obtain additional licenses, consents or permissions from others.

7. Disclaimer. ALL MATERIALS PROVIDED BY GRAMMARLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE STUDY, INCLUDING ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

8. Limitations of Liability. GRAMMARLY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THEIR SUBJECT MATTER, WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, GRAMMARLY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU, IF ANY, WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

9. General. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any amendment must be in writing and signed by both parties. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. No failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver. If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, such provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms otherwise remain in full force and effect. You may not assign these Terms to any party without our prior written consent and any attempt to do so will be void; and we may assign these Terms to any party without your consent.  We may use the services of third-party vendors and may permit them to exercise all rights granted to us under these Terms for the purposes of helping us conduct the Study. These Terms supersede all prior discussions and writings and constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Study. These Terms apply to participation in the Study and any Study sessions (including future sessions), and will remain in effect until terminated. Either of us may terminate these Terms at any time with written notice to the other party, but Grammarly’s rights and your obligations in these Terms survive after termination of these Terms or the Study.
